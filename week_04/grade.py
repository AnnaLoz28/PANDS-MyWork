# grade.py
# program that reads in a studentâ€™s percentage mark and prints out corresponding the grade (the program should check that the percentage is valid):
#   Under 40% => Fail
#   Between 40% and 49% => Pass
#   Between 50% and 59% => Merit 2
#   Between 60% and 69% => Merit 1
#   Over 70% => Distinction
